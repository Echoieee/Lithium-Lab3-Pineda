		<h1> Elden Ring </h1>
		<p>The elden ring is a culmination of different powers that are stored in and represented by the Great Runes. Having all these runes/powers at the same time is being in possession of the elden ring. These runes control aspects of reality so whoever controls the elden ring has supreme sovereignty over the Lands Between. </p>
